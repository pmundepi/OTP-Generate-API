# OTP-Generate-API

This code is written in JavaScript and uses the Express framework to create a server. The server listens on port 3000 and has an API endpoint /generateOTP which generates a 6 digit OTP (One Time Password) using the generateOTP() function.
The generateOTP() function generates a random 6 digit number using the Math.random() function and returns it as a string. The server uses the CORS middleware to allow cross-origin requests.
You can use this code as a starting point to create your own server with an OTP generation API endpoint. 
You can modify the code to generate OTPs of different lengths or add additional functionality to the server.
